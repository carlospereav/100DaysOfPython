Hello there, I'm Carlos Perea.

Recently I decided to take 100 Days of Python Course by Angela Yu on Udemy.

I took this course to improve my skills in python, while also building my portofolio.

This repository contain some of the final projects, purely made by myself without the course's guidance.

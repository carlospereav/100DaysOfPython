Hello there, I'm Carlos Perea.

Recently I decided to take 100 Days of Python Course by Angela Yu on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

I took this course to improve my skills in python, while also building my portofolio.

This repository contain some of the final projects, purely made by myself without the course's guidance.

# Final Projects
- [Analyse and Visualise the Space Race](https://github.com/carlospereav/100DaysOfPython/blob/main/Space%2BMissions%2B(start)/Space_Missions_Analysis_(start).ipynb) (Data Science)
- [Analyze Deaths Involving the Police in USA](https://github.com/carlospereav/100DaysOfPython/blob/main/Fatal%2BForce%2B(start)/Fatal_Force_(start).ipynb) (Data Science)
